Enterprise Agentic AI Portfolio 
Seasoned BI & Data Specialist â†’ GenAI Architect

Vision
As a Seasoned BI & Data Specialist with deep expertise in full-stack data architecture, I understand the complexities of enterprise data ecosystems, the necessity of strong governance, the high cost of inefficiencies, and the need for a centralized governance team to proactively guide and harmonize technology stacks as they evolve.


This portfolio demonstrates Agentic AI solutions crafted to address critical, high-impact pain points that enterprises face during their AI/ML adoption journey.

These are not hobby experiments â€” they are pragmatic, production-oriented agents engineered to integrate seamlessly with BI platforms, governance frameworks, and enterprise security policies. Each one is built as a repeatable pattern for enterprise-scale deployment.

ðŸš€ Enterprise-Focused Agents
1. AI Environment Provisioning Portal â€“ One-Click, Multi-Team Setup
Pain Point: AI/ML adoption is slowed by fragmented environments, inconsistent configurations, security risks, and duplicated provisioning work.
Solution: A self-service portal that lets multiple teams log in, select AI models, databases, storage, secrets managers, and enterprise data sources â†’ provisions complete, secure, and standardized environments in minutes using pre-approved configurations.
Key Features:

Multi-team login with secure access control

Select components via simple web UI

Automated orchestration with enterprise patterns

Deployment options for both internal and production environments
Stack: Streamlit Â· LangChain Â· Doppler Â· Supabase Â· Docker Â· Python Virtual Environments.

2. Reporting Scanner Agent
Pain Point: Fragmented KPIs across Tableau, Power BI, and Excel cause misaligned reporting and lack of a single version of truth.
Solution: Scans dashboards/exports â†’ builds a centralized KPI matrix with department, business definition, and technical logic.
Stack: LangChain + FAISS + OpenAI/Ollama + Streamlit.

3. Mock Data Generator Agent (MockGen AI)
Pain Point: QA/Dev teams need realistic, relationship-preserving datasets without exposing sensitive production data.
Solution: Reads schema from Excel (1 dimension + 1 fact) â†’ generates referentially-intact mock data for testing.
Design Constraint: No direct enterprise DB access; LLM runs locally or with approved extracts only.
Stack: Python + Faker + LangChain + Streamlit.

4. Data Governance Agent
Pain Point: Governance violations often surface too late in the delivery cycle, causing expensive rework.
Solution: Post-Airflow DAG completion â†’ fetches governance rules from Confluence â†’ validates table metadata â†’ flags violations instantly.
Mode: One-shot, automated, zero user interaction.

5. Naming Convention Validator
Pain Point: Inconsistent naming conventions break lineage tracking, governance, and BI discoverability.
Solution: Reads Excel in SharePoint â†’ validates schema/table/column names against enterprise rules â†’ outputs a structured violations report.
Mode: Fully automated, batch execution.

6. Query Optimization Recommender
Pain Point: Inefficient and repetitive queries waste compute resources and slow down analytics delivery.
Solution: Analyzes Redshift query logs â†’ clusters repetitive patterns â†’ uses LLM to recommend optimizations or materialized views.
Output: Static recommendation reports for architect review.

7. Interactive Optimization Copilot
Pain Point: Query optimization is siloed, untracked, and often manual.
Solution: Works interactively with architects to iteratively rewrite queries, track decisions, and coordinate optimization workflows.
Strength: Orchestrates multiple agents and maintains multi-step optimization flows.

Why This Portfolio Stands Out for Enterprises
Built from a BI & Data Specialistâ€™s Perspective â†’ grounded in governance, scalability, and enterprise-grade integration.

Directly Solves Enterprise Bottlenecks â†’ focusing on speed, standardization, and security in AI/ML adoption.

Agentic by Design â†’ each agent can run autonomously or collaborate as part of multi-agent orchestration.

Production-Ready Patterns â†’ designed with Doppler, Docker, Supabase, GitHub Actions, and Streamlit for frictionless deployment.
